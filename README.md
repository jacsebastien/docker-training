# Docker Training

This repository contains all my code about docker training following this [Docker Mastery: with Kubernetes +Swarm from a Docker Captain](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery) Udemy course.

The repo is divided into several branches, one by exercise.

The main branch is used as a startup and documentation page, no code is supposed to stand here.

Each branch contains a README file with the instructions about the exercise, followed by my solution.
